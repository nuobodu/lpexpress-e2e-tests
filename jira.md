# Project Management Workflow (Jira)

This project utilized a dedicated Jira project board to manage the E2E test automation lifecycle, from initial requirement definition to test execution and completion. This approach demonstrates structured agile practices, including sprint planning, task tracking, and integration with the GitHub repository.

---

## 1. Sprint Creation and Backlog Definition

The project started by defining the initial backlog items (Epics and Stories) based on the test plan, and organizing them into **Sprint 1**. Each story contains detailed **Test Steps** and **Expected Results**.

## 2. GitHub Integration

The Jira environment was linked directly to the GitHub repository. This automation allowed to see the corresponding **commits** and **build status** directly on the Jira ticket (LEET-7), ensuring full traceability between the ticket, the code, and the continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

## 3. Completing Test Automation

Tasks were progressed through the workflow (To Do, In Progress, Done) as development and testing concluded. Once the automated tests were written and committed, the tickets were marked as **Done**, providing a visual record of the project's completion.

## 4. Sprint 2 Planning and Creation

This image shows **Sprint 2** being created and populated with the additional **7 E2E test cases** (LEET-15 through LEET-21) required to meet the minimum test case count of 15. The sprint is ready to be started.

## 5. Sprint 2 Execution (In Progress)

This screenshot illustrates **Sprint 2 in progress**, with detailed information filled into a sample ticket (LEET-15). The workflow columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) are active, demonstrating continuous progression toward full automation coverage.

## 6. Sprint 2 Completion

This image confirms the **completion of Sprint 2**. All 7 additional test cases (LEET-15 through LEET-21) are marked as **DONE**, signifying that the required E2E automation has been fully implemented, tested, and integrated.
